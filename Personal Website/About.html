            Computer Systems have fascinated me ever since I was young. I still remember the moments 
            I was voluntold to be my home's unofficial I.T. department when our internet would go down 
            or our computer would get a virus. I remember feeling like a hacker as the Earthlink or 
            Digis tech would walk me through running the command line over the phone or pouring over our 
            system's programs until I identified that one file that was infected. That fascination led me 
            to doing some free coding courses online and feeling invigorated. 
            <br/><br/>
            Two years into college, I decided to finally pursue that passion and switched 
            my major from Technical Theater to Computer Science. The juxtaposition of switching from 
            art to engineering was intimidating because I felt like I was somewhere I didn't belong 
            but I kept a positive attitude and kept telling myself "you CAN do this". This drive and 
            passion has taken me through my education at Weber State University where I plan to graduate 
            in August. They have provided me with an invaluable education in Computer Science with expert instruction in
            object-oriented programming, operating systems, web development, graphics programming, higher mathematics, 
            Computer Theory, networking and network security, and more. I still carry the creativity 
            I learned through a lifelong passion for theater and acting with me as it has made me a better 
            developer and given me excellent interpersonal communication skills.
            <br/><br/>
            This career choice has been the most challenging and humbling journey I've been on but he challenge makes 
            me hunger for more. I am eager to apply my passion and creativity in Industry. There is always
            more to learn and I feel I have a lot to bring to the table as a developer.

                            I have been an actor almost all my life. My family was heavily into theater and so, naturally, so was I. 
                            The passion began in a small community theater in Custer, South Dakota and was heavily influenced by my older brother
                            who stayed the course and is now a professional actor in Washington, D.C. In addition to being a theater kid all through
                            Elementary, Middle, and High School, I spent my summers attending an acting camp at the Utah Shakespeare Festival in
                            Cedar City, Utah where we were trained working professional actors. Apart from being in Annie Get Your Gun at the Ogden
                            Egyptian Theater, my passion for acting was put on hold since changing my major to Computer Science but I hope to get back 
                            on the horse when I graduate.

                            Fitness is one of my biggest passions ever since high school when I took a weight lifting class. Since then I have found pleasure
                            in studying fitness and nutrition and trying different kinds of fitness. I'm fascinated by the human body and how different foods
                            and exercise techniques affect the way it functions. It's amazing how our understanding of these two topic is evolving year by year.

                        Travelling has always been a huge part of my life. Growing up, my family traveled to many places across the US and abroad. My 
                        parents being employees of the Forest Service and lovers of the outdoors led them to instill in us that same love and passion. 
                        They loved taking us to National Parks across the country with their favorites being Glacier, Yellowstone, Arches, Bryce Canyon,
                        Fort Jefferson, Zion, and Olympic. My family also had a love of history so we spent many summers traveling up and down the east
                        coast to various Civil War and Revolutionary War hotspots. I have also been to Hawaii, the Bahamas, Canada, France, the U.K., 
                        Germany, and the Netherlands. Travel is something that is engrained in my soul and I can't live without.

                        In the past couple years, I have discovered an interest in learning. Whether it be DIY skills, history, science,
                        medicine, software or web skills, philosophy, among other topics, I have a thirst for knowledge. Although being a 
                        college student makes finding time for other interests difficult.
